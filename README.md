### Welcome!ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick. I'm a developer currently studying in the DigitalCrafts Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp. I'm originally from Houston, TX. However, I'm a nomad so you may see out in the wild anywhere. My personal interests range from woodworking/carpentry to Star Wars to baseball (playing or watching) and so much more in-between. I welcome any opportunities for collaboration or notes on the projects in my repositories.
